The program takes the name of the file to parse as a parameter, it returns the json file displayed in the command prompt.

The code is composed of the main function which calls the processMail function to process the data. It then calls the toJSON function to transform the data into a json file and then displays it.

If the lines are not always in the same order, the program will not be affected.
